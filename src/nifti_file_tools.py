File: nifti_file_tools.py

Description:
This file contains utility functions for processing NIfTI files, specifically focusing on operations related to 3D and 4D volumes. 
Functions include combining multiple 3D volumes into a single 4D NIfTI volume, aggregating and saving 4D NIfTI files, creating repeated NIfTI images, 
and merging matrices from text files into a 4D NIfTI image. These functions leverage the capabilities of the nibabel and numpy libraries for neuroimaging 
data manipulation.
