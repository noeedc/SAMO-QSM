Patch Generation and Image Reconstruction Script

Author: No√©e Ducros-Chabot
Created: 12/06/2023
Last Modified : 23/11/2023

Description:
This script defines functions to randomly extract 3D patches from an image, generate patches using sliding window, and reconstruct an image from overlapping patches. The script also includes an example usage section.

Libraries Used:
- src.normalize.normalize
- numpy
- nibabel

Functions:
- random_patches_3D_with_indices
- generate_3D_rand_patches
- sliding_window_3d_with_indices
- generate_3D_sliding_window_patches
- reconstruct_image_with_overlap

Usage:
- Modify the file paths and parameters in the example usage section according to your specific task.
- Execute the script using the Python interpreter.

Note:
- Ensure that the required libraries are installed before running the script.
- Adjust the script parameters and configurations as needed.
